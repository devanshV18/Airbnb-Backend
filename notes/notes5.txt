### VVVVIII
his is called the error-handling middleware — like your genericErrorHandler.

How do errors reach it?
There are two ways:

next(error) — this is the official, Express way to forward an error to the error middleware.

throw error — works too if you’re using async/await, because Express handles rejected promises using next(error) under the hood.

so for async functions do return next(,..............("Error")) #########
